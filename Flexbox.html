            <p class="description">The first time I tasted the warmth of traditional Japanese style ramen, it instantly became one of my all-time favorite foods of all time. The brothy bowl filled
            my satisfaction of eating a soothing and warm, yet flavorful soup. The unique contents of the bowl, from the smooth noodles to the fish cakes, took me on a cultural adventure.
            This is just one of the instances of me enjoying the distinctiveness of Japanese food. Other foods I like are the iconic sushi rolls, onigiri rice balls, and poke bowls. There's just
            such a great variety of foods to try.
