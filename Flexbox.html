                <p class="description">The first time I tasted the warmth of traditional Japanese style ramen, it instantly became one of my all-time favorite foods of all time.
                     The brothy bowl filled my satisfaction of eating a soothing and warm, yet flavorful soup. The unique contents of the bowl, from the smooth noodles to the fish cakes, took me on a cultural adventure.
            This is just one of the instances of me enjoying the distinctiveness of Japanese food. Other Japanese foods include the iconic sushi rolls, onigiri rice balls, and poke bowls. There's just
            such a great variety of foods to try.
